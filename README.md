Flixbus delays collects arrival times from the Flixbus website at a certain bus station for a certain specified time frame. 
Example dataset: Arrivals in Paris (Bercy) at 19th June 2024. 
Includes, planned and observed times, previous stop, first stop and total trip duration. 
Please Check:
-  flixbus page code versions may change periodically
-  language used (my code assumes dutch is the language used), though by changing the language few code changes are needed. 
-  version of chrome driver is exactly the same as the version of google chrome
-  bus stop name must exist
-  bus stop has at least one arrival or departure
